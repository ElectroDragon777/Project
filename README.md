# Project
This project's purpose is to show how Stack and recursion work.
Exercise 1:
We are using Stack (System.Collections.Generic to call it) to mirror a string. We split the string by SPACE character and add it to a string array, for which we use "foreach" to get every single word in it.
The Stack is LIFO (Last in, first out) which means the last thing that gets pushed to the Stack (Stack.Push() is to add the elements) comes first.
